# Transformations to Sliver

This file contains all SQL transformation logic used to clean and normalize the original Olist dataset. Each raw CSV file was ingested into the **Bronze layer**, and then transformed into clean, query-ready tables in the **Silver layer** using Athena SQL.

All outputs were written to S3 in **Parquet format** with **Snappy compression**, and partitioned where applicable.

## ðŸ§¹ Cleaned Tables Summary (Silver Layer)

### 1. `orders_clean`
- Cast all timestamps, lowercase IDs
- Derived `order_year` and `order_month` partitions
- Flagged bad records where delivery happened before purchase

```sql
CREATE TABLE olist_db.orders_clean
WITH (
    format = 'PARQUET', write_compression = 'SNAPPY',
    external_location = 's3://olist-ecommerce-analysis-project/silver/orders_clean/',
    partitioned_by = ARRAY['order_year', 'order_month']
) AS
SELECT
    -- Normalize identifiers to lowercase for consistent joins
    lower(col0) AS order_id,
    lower(col1) AS customer_id,
    lower(col2) AS order_status,
    
    -- Normalize timestamp column names to *_ts and cast explicitly
    TRY_CAST(col3 AS timestamp) AS order_purchase_ts,
    TRY_CAST(col4 AS timestamp) AS order_approved_ts,
    TRY_CAST(col5 AS timestamp) AS delivered_carrier_ts,
    TRY_CAST(col6 AS timestamp) AS delivered_customer_ts,
    TRY_CAST(col7 AS timestamp) AS estimated_delivery_ts,

    -- Data quality flag: delivered earlier than purchase â‡’ bad record
    CASE WHEN TRY_CAST(col6 AS timestamp) IS NOT null
        AND TRY_CAST(col3 AS timestamp) IS NOT null
        AND TRY_CAST(col6 AS timestamp) < TRY_CAST(col3 AS timestamp)
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 
    END AS bad_record,
    
     -- Partitioning columns derived from purchase timestamp
    year(TRY_CAST(col3 AS timestamp)) AS order_year, 
    month(TRY_CAST(col3 AS timestamp)) AS order_month
FROM olist_db.raw_orders;
````

### 2. `customers_clean`
