# Olist Ecommerce Analytics â€” Case Study (AWS Lakehouse)

## ðŸ“¦ Project Overview
We built a monthly GMV dashboard for Olist to track business performance. In August 2018, GMV dropped even though orders increased, which triggered a deeper analysis.

We decomposed GMV into orders and AOV, then split AOV into Mix (structural shifts) and Like-for-Like (within-segment changes). Mix was stable, but Like-for-Like fell.

Going further, we compared average unit price and items per order between July and August 2018. Unit price dropped sharply, while basket size stayed roughly the same. This shows the AOV decline was price-driven, likely due to deeper discounts, rather than fewer items per order.

This case study highlights how a clear step-by-step approach can reveal true performance drivers and guide pricing strategy in key categories or regions.
